# **Stock Analysis**

## **Overview of Project**
---
This is a stock analysis using a refactored code which can also be used for analysing the entire stock market over the last few years.
### **Purpose**

The purpose of this project is to compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script

## **Analysis and Challenges**
### **Stock Analysis for 2017**

As shown above,
   --1.DQ gave the highest return for the year 
   --2.There were 4 tickers that gave more than 100% returns
   --3. TERP was the only ticker which did not yield a positive return

As shown above, 
  -- 1. Tickers ENPH and RUN had high returns in 2018
  -- 2. All the other stocks were underperforming.
### **Code Efficiency**

- As shown above, the script run time slightly improved for the 2 years under review.
---
### **Advantages of refactoring code in general**
---
Refactoring a code means editing a code. It is usually done to make the code more efficient by using fewer steps/less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read.

### **Disadvantages of refactoring code in general**
  Time consuming, and confusing.

## **Advantages of the original and refactored VBA script**
---
- The original script was easy to understand
- The refactored script is slightly more efficient. 
---
## **Disadvantages of of the original and refactored VBA script**

- Refactored script was a bit confusing
- Efficiency was more or less same as original script
